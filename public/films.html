 <h1>My Favorite Films of All Time</h1>

 <h2>(And why they are)</h2>
 <hr>

    <h3>1. Interstellar</h3>
    <p>I generally like science-related things, especially when they involve space.
        I find the pursuit for the unknown very intriguing, and this movie definitely delivered in terms of story-telling and cinematography.</p>

    <h3>2. Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>I am also a big fan of anime, but I chose this film specifically because of the various metaphors and symbolisms you can find in Hayao Miyazaki's films. 
        Needless to say, Studio Ghibli's animations give you that nostalgic feel, where you feel comfort no matter what story is being told.</p>
            
    <h3>3. Spiderman: Across the Spider-verse</h3>
    <p>This one is a little more personal, because a huge factor of why this movie is one of my favorites is because it was THE movie that we watched together when we got back together. 
        The music also felt right (specifically Mona Lisa by Dominic Fike). We never thought we'd get back together but this movie was our first date together after a long time. (P.S. Spiderman is my favorite superhero).
